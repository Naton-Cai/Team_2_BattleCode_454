# **Battlecode 2026: Uneasy Alliances**

_Note:_ **_Rat_** _refers to a generic rat of any type, if baby rat or rat king is not specified._

## **Background (lore)**

_(All animals mentioned are robots. No animals were harmed in the making of this game.)_

Deep beneath the abandoned dorms of MIT, thanks to a student letting their failed final project loose on campus, a robotic rat society consisting of clans of baby rats led by noble rat kings has formed. Like all developing societies, there is, of course, conflict. It is not chromatic, but it is dangerous. You have heard tales of many large, hungry robot cats (someone else’s failed project, probably) that are on the prowl for sustenance. As such, your society and a nearby society have formed an uneasy alliance.

Before your clan’s baby rats begin fighting the cat, you must remember the task you were born with: _protect your noble rat kings._

## **Objective**

Collect cheese, stay alive, defeat the cats, and choose whether or not to stay cooperating with your enemy. Mindgame your opponent by scoring more points than them to win the match.

Each **match** is split into **3 games** , each of which is split into **2000 rounds** (i.e. robot turns).

An even number of cats will spawn in the map at the start of a game, and they will try to kill the rats of both teams. Every game will start in cooperation mode, where you will work with the other team to attack the cats. If all the cats are defeated, teams will earn points in a way that depends heavily on their contribution to the victory (i.e. how much damage each team did to the cats).

However, at any point in each game, you may also choose to backstab your opponent, ending the cooperation immediately. After a backstab, you must not only defend your rat kings against the cats but also the other rat team. In backstabbing mode, a team’s points will be more heavily dependent on the survival of their rat kings and less on their contribution to the defeat of the cats.

Good luck!

## **Cooperation & Backstabbing**

The game has 2 possible phases: cooperation and backstabbing. Each game begins in cooperation. Teams may choose to betray one another over the course of a game. Either team can backstab at any time. A

backstab is initiated once one team causes any rat from the other team to lose health or when a ratnapping\* occurs.

In other words, a backstab is initiated when:

1. A rat attacks (bites) an enemy rat

2. A rat triggers a trap set by the enemy team

3. A rat ratnaps an enemy rat

For example, if a baby rat triggers an enemy trap, the game state changes to backstabbing in the same round, immediately following that rat’s turn. (The game state will reset to cooperation at the start of the next game of the match.)

\*See “Rat” section for more details

### **Win conditions**

Each match is played as a best of 3 games. For any game, regardless of the state (cooperation or backstabbing), if all rat kings of any team die for any reason, the game ends at that round and that team auto-loses the game. _The only exception is if all rat kings of both teams die in the_ **_same round_** , in which case the point system (see below) is used to calculate the winner

If all cats are defeated in cooperation mode, the game ends at that round. The winning team is determined by the team with more points, where points will be awarded to the point system below.

If all cats are defeated in backstabbing mode, the game does not end, as you are not only up against the cats but also the enemy team. You must keep fighting until one team loses all their rat kings (at which point that team auto-loses that game) or the end of the game (round 2000) is reached. If both teams make it to the end of the game (i.e. both teams have at least 1 surviving rat king for all 2000 rounds), points are awarded to each team based on the point system below.

#### **Point system**

When using the point system, the winner of a game is determined by the team with more points. Points are awarded based on the game state (cooperation or backstabbing) and the following factors: damage dealt to cats, number of living rat kings, and amount of cheese transferred by baby rats to the rat king.

If the game concludes in **cooperation** state, each team will be rewarded points based on the following formula:

round(0.5 _ % damage to cat + 0.3 _ % of living rat kings + 0.2 \* % cheese transferred) [Eq. 1]

If instead the game concludes in **backstabbing** state, each team will be rewarded points based on the following formula:

round(0.3 _ % damage done to cat + 0.5 _ % of living rat kings + 0.2 \* % cheese transferred) [Eq. 2]

Note the following calculations:

- % damage to cat is the amount of damage (i.e. through biting or cat trap triggers) your team did to the cats divided by the total amount of damage both teams did to the cat; 0 if no damage was done to the cats across both teams

- % living rat kings is the number of living rat kings you have at the end of the game divided by the total number of living rat kings across both teams at the end of the game

- % cheese is the amount of cheese your team transferred (via baby rats) to the rat king divided by the total amount of cheese transferred (via baby rats) to the rat king across both teams

The 3 criteria (cheese transferred to king, damage to cats, and number living rat kings) for points calculations are shown in the client as such: (Cheese -> Amount / Percent; Cat -> Damage / Percent; Rat King -> Count / Percent)

**Tiebreakers** : If both teams end with the same number of points, the following tiebreakers will be applied, in order of priority:

1. Sum of the amount of global cheese the team has at the end of the game

2. Sum of number of total rats (baby rats and rat kings) alive at the end of the game

If teams are still tied after applying tiebreakers, a uniformly random team will be selected.

## **Map overview**

Each Battlecode game will be played on a map. The map is a discrete 2-dimensional rectangular grid, of size ranging between **20×20** and **60×60** inclusive. The bottom-left corner of the map will have coordinates (0, 0); coordinates increase East (right) and North (up). Coordinates on the map are represented as MapLocation objects holding the x and y coordinates of the location.

In order to prevent maps from favoring one player over another, it is guaranteed that the world is symmetric either by rotation or horizontal/vertical reflection.

### **Visibility and Passability**

All robots will have a facing direction that is one of the following 8 directions. A robot’s vision cone will be centered on the robot's facing direction, and it defines the region in which it can sense map features and other robots. You can sense a multi-tile robot by sensing any of its occupied robot locations, not just the center.

Baby rats can sense map features (i.e. walls, dirt, cheese, traps, center of cheese mines) and other robots up to √20 units away in the 90 degree cone that they are facing towards. Rat kings have a √25 unit vision radius in all directions (i.e. 360 degree vision cone).

### **Walls and Dirt**

Map walls and dirt are impassable for all unit types. No more than **20%** of a map will be walls. No more than **50%** of a map will be dirt.

Rats and cats may dig (i.e. remove) or place dirt that it owns onto the map but cannot modify walls. Dirt that is removed by a rat is added to a team’s global dirt stash, from which any rats on the same team may use to place dirt on an unoccupied tile.

Digging and placing dirt can only be done **within the rat’s vision cone** and in tiles that are **directly adjacent** to the robot. Effectively, this means rat kings can dig/place dirt on any tiles within a distance of (3/2 + √2) of their center, and baby rats can dig/place dirt on any tiles within a distance of (0.5 + √2) of their center.

## **Resources**

### **Cheese**

Cheese is the primary resource in this game. Teams can spend cheese to perform actions like building traps, modifying dirt, spawning rats, etc. Rat kings also need to consume cheese each round to maintain its health.

Cheese can either be accessed by anyone on the team ( **global cheese** ) or a single baby rat ( **raw cheese** ). When a baby rat first collects cheese, it is raw, but once it delivers it to a rat king, it becomes global cheese.

Each team starts with **2500** global cheese.

There will be an even number of cheese mines located throughout the map, with a minimum distance of 5 between them. Cheese will be spawned at random in the 9x9 square near these cheese mines. Cheese can only spawn in places that the cat can access, and rats can sense cheese once it is in their vision cone.

Each mine will spawn **20 cheese** on a random location with a probability of (1 - (1 - 0.01)^r) each round, where r is the number of rounds since a cheese was last spawned at the mine. Cheese will always spawn symmetrically across the map. Cheese will not spawn on walls but can spawn on dirt.

Baby rats can collect cheese in adjacent locations only. Rat kings can only collect cheese that they are currently standing on top of. When a baby rat collects cheese, the baby rat must bring it back to a rat king in order for the cheese to enter the global cheese pool. Any cheese collected by a rat king is directly converted to global cheese and enters the team’s shared cheese pool. When rats spend cheese, their local (raw) cheese is spent first followed by global cheese.

Baby rats carrying cheese are _slowed down by their stash of raw cheese_ , with a **movement and action cooldown multiplier of 0.01 \* (amount of raw cheese carried)** .

If a baby rat dies, its locally held raw cheese will be dropped at its location.

### **Dirt**

Dirt is the secondary resource in the game. The map may begin with dirt present. 1 block of dirt is gained by digging up an existing block of dirt on the map. Immediately upon digging, blocks of dirt are a global team resource.

Any dirt dug by the cat is permanently removed from the map.

## **Units**

The Battlecode world contains many kinds of robots. All robots can perform actions such as moving, sensing, and communicating with each other. In each battle, your robots will face one opposing enemy team as well as cat robots.

Each game is turn-based and divided into **rounds** . In each round, every robot gets a **turn** in which it gets a chance to run code and take actions. Code that a robot runs costs **bytecodes** , a measure of computational resources. A robot only has a predetermined amount of bytecodes available per turn, after which the robot's turn is immediately ended and computations are resumed on its next turn. If your robot has finished its turn, it should call Clock.yield() to wait for the next turn to begin.

All robots have a certain amount of HP (also known as hitpoints, health, life, or such). When a robot's HP reaches zero, the robot is immediately removed from the game and any cheese it is holding is dropped on the tile where it died.

Robots are assigned unique random IDs no smaller than 10,000. All units on the starting map begin facing the map center.

Robots interact with only their nearby surroundings through sensing, moving, and special abilities. Each robot runs an independent copy of your code. Robots will be unable to share static variables (they will each have their own copy), because they are run in separate JVMs.

Two or more robots may not be on the same square unless one is ratnapping the other. When their movement cooldown goes below 10, robots can move onto any of the 8 neighboring squares. All units also have facing directions, which determine the center axis of their vision cone. The 8 possible facing directions are North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest. When a robot’s turning cooldown goes below 10, robots can turn to any of these facing directions.

To obey map symmetry, all robots (rats and cats) have a notion of **chirality** which affects the order in which they sense locations in the world and (for multi-tile robots) the order in which they retrieve their part locations. For example, for a map with vertical symmetry, one team’s robots will sense the world in increasing x and y values while the other team’s robots will sense the world in decreasing x values and increasing y values.

Robot **turn order** within each round is determined by the order in which the robots spawn into the world. At the start of the game, this means cats act last, after all existing rats. However, as teams spawn/build more rats throughout the game, newly spawned baby rats and rat kings will receive their turn after the cats, in the order that they entered the game.

### **Cooldowns**

All robots have movement, turning, and action cooldowns which determine whether they are able to move, turn, and take actions respectively on a given turn. Actions consist of any non-moving and non-turning related behaviors, not including sensing and communicating. Most actions will incur some amount of cooldown increase, and at the beginning of each round of a game all robot movement, turning, and action cooldowns are decreased by 10. Robots can perform movement, turning, and actions once their respective cooldowns are less than 10.

## **Baby Rat**

Baby rats are spawned by rat kings and start with a health of **100 HP** . Once a robot’s health reaches 0, it dies. Baby rats have a **forward movement cooldown of 10** , a **strafe movement cooldown of 18** , and a **turning cooldown of 10** . (Strafing is moving in 1 of the 7 non-facing directions.)

### **Attack**

Any rat may bite any enemy rat, rat king, or cat that is at one of the _8 adjacent locations_ and is _within its vision radius_ . This does **10 damage** to the bitten robot if no cheese is consumed.

A rat may spend cheese to increase the damage done by a single bite. Spending X amount of cheese on a bite will **increase the damage of the bite by ceil(sqrt(X))** damage. Raw cheese will be consumed before global cheese.

### **Ratnapping / Carrying**

Baby rats can ratnap (i.e. carry) other baby rats around the map. A baby rat can ratnap any allied or enemy baby rat in an adjacent location that it can see (within a ratnapping radius of √2), given the baby rat of interest meets one of the following criteria:

- They are facing away (i.e. the other rat cannot sense this rat)

- They have less health

- They are on your team

A baby rat can drop a ratnapped rat at any time on an adjacent location that is passable and not occupied by another rat. If a ratnapped rat is not dropped within 10 rounds, it will be automatically dropped in the tile directly in front of the carrier. If the drop location is occupied or impassable, no drop will occur and instead a swap will take place where the original carrier will be carried by the originally ratnapped rat. Rat A cannot ratnap an enemy rat B until two turns after B hits another unit, a wall, or the ground (due to throwing or dropping) if A was the rat which most recently carried B (but any baby rat other than A can ratnap B during this time).

At any time, a rat can ratnap at most one other rat. Upon being ratnapped, a rat will immediately drop any rat it is currently carrying to occupy the spot it was just in. If, for instance, rat A is currently carrying rat B, and rat C begins carrying rat A, rat A will stop carrying rat B.

Any ratnapped rat will assume its original (pre-ratnapped) facing direction when it is dropped.

Explicitly calling the functions to either pick up or drop a rat both have an **action cooldown of 20** .

### **Ratnapped rat**

The carried rat occupies the same tile as the carrying rat. Rats currently being ratnapped can squeak (see communication section) and sense but cannot perform any other actions, movement, or turning. For as long as a rat is being carried, it is temporarily **stunned** , meaning it is unable to move, place traps, dig/place dirt, etc. However, the ratnapped rat is immune to attacks while it is carried; e.g. if a cat scratches at its location, only the carrier rat will be harmed. _The exception is a cat pounce or a cat moving over a rat, which will destroy both the carrier and ratnapped rat._

### **Throwing**

Rats being carried can be thrown, given there is at least 1 empty (passable, non-occupied) space in front of the ratnapper where the thrown rat can land. A rat performing a throw action incurs an action cooldown increase of **20** . A thrown rat is immobilized and travels forward at **2 tiles per turn for 4 of its turns** , unless it hits an obstacle (i.e. an impassable tile or another rat) at which point it drops to the ground.

Upon landing on the ground, the flying rat is **stunned** , losing **10 HP of health** and incurring a movement, turning, and action cooldown of **10** and **20** for the cases of dropping after four turns and for hitting a target respectively. If the thrown rat lands prematurely (due to hitting an obstacle) the thrown rat and any rat hit as collateral will incur **4 \* (remaining tiles) HP loss**, where “remaining tiles” refers to the number of additional tiles the thrown rat had left to travel flying if it hadn’t hit an obstacle. Remaining tiles will be 2 \* (remaining airborne time the rat had upon collision) since rats travel flying at 2 tiles per turn.

Note that reaching the edge of the map is _not considered an obstacle_ and a rat that must land early due to reaching the map edge will only incur the 10 HP damage.

Any rats hit as collateral are not stunned.

A rat being thrown _will not trigger traps, cannot be attacked, and cannot pick up cheese or perform any actions except communicating and sensing_ . A thrown rat’s location is **impassable** and **can be sensed** by the location’s MapInfo **.** If flying robot X hits flying robot Y, flying robot X will incur the same damage and stun of hitting an obstacle prematurely and drop to the ground; flying robot Y will only drop to the ground and incur the damage/stun of a regular (non-early) landing after being thrown.

If a thrown baby rat hits a cat on its path, it will get eaten by the cat and the cat will fall asleep for 2 turns.

### **Placing traps**

Rats can place a trap on any unoccupied (i.e. no cheese mine, wall, or dirt) and passable tile. This action **costs 20 cheese** and has an **action cooldown of 15** . A maximum of **25 rat traps per team** can be active at any given time. A rat trap is triggered by an enemy rat stepping in a **radius of √2** ; a triggered trap **deals 50 damage** to that rat and stuns the rat, preventing it from moving for 3 turns by adding 30 to its movement cooldown. Traps can be triggered by rats moving into the trigger radius or if they land in that region after being thrown or if they are dropped in that region after being carried.

Your team is immune to the traps you place (you can only get hurt by your opponent’s traps). Traps are visible to allied rats but hidden from enemy rats and the cat. All traps are removed after they are triggered once.

During cooperation, if a rat on the other team triggers your trap, this will be treated as the start of a backstab.

Rats can also use placeCatTrap() on any tile during the **cooperation** phase OR if you are the backstabbed team and it has been <= 100 rounds since you were backstabbed; rats may not place cat traps after the game has switched to backstabbing state. (Previously placed cat traps will remain however). Placing a cat trap action **costs 10 cheese** and has an **action cooldown of 10** . A cat trap is triggered by a cat stepping in a **radius of √2** ; a triggered trap **deals 100 damage** to the cat and stuns it, preventing it from moving for 2 turns (by adding 20 to its movement cooldown). Stuns do not stack if there are multiple cat traps triggered at once, but damage does stack. There can be at most **10 cat traps per team** on the map at once.

Rats can remove any allied traps that are within their vision and are directly adjacent to them. Removing a trap will not refund the cheese spent to build the trap. There is no associated cooldown increase for trap removal.

### **Digging/Placing Dirt**

Rats can remove dirt from any immediately adjacent location that they can sense. Dirt is a global and conserved resource so dirt mined at one location can be used by other rats on the same team. For all rats, digging dirt costs **5 cheese** and incurs an **action cooldown of 25** . Placing dirt incurs the same action cooldown but costs no cheese. Rats can put dirt from their team’s stash at any location that is not occupied by a robot, wall, dirt, cheese, or cheese mine.

## **Rat King**

Every team begins with 1 rat king. It occupies a 3 by 3 square.

Each rat king consumes **2 cheese** at the end of each round, and if the supply of cheese is not enough for any rat king, it will **lose 10 HP** of its health and doesn’t consume any cheese. Rat kings start consuming cheese in the order that they were created. Rat kings also start with **600 HP** . They have a **movement cooldown of 40** (in any direction) and a **turning cooldown of 10** . If all of a team’s rat kings die, the opposing team immediately wins.

Rat kings can attack, place, destroy dirt, and squeak, similar to a baby rat.

### **Rat King creation**

In addition to the rat king created at the start of the game, if there are 7 or more allied rats within a baby rat’s surrounding 3 by 3 square, the center baby rat can upgrade into a rat king. The surrounding 3 by 3 square cannot have any impassable tiles or intersect with existing rat kings or cats.

Baby rats turning into a rat king retain their current action and movement cooldowns of the center rat. The newly formed rat king’s health is the sum of the healths of the individual rats, capped at a rat king’s starting health of 600. Any baby rats (allied or enemy) in the surrounding 3 by 3 square of the center baby rat will be destroyed upon rat king formation, and any raw cheese held locally by these baby rats will be incorporated into the new rat king’s team’s global cheese stash. Following this, any traps whose trigger radius touches the 3 by 3 square will be triggered upon rat king creation.

Upgrading to rat king requires **50 cheese** . A team _may not have more than 5 rat kings_ at one time. No new rat kings can be created after round 1200 while the team has two or more living rat kings, but this rule never causes living rat kings to be destroyed.

### **Spawning baby rats**

Baby rats can be spawned by the rat king at any empty location directly adjacent to the rat king’s. The spawned baby rat’s initial facing direction will be the parent rat king’s current facing direction.

Each robot spawn costs **10 cheese** , increased by _10 more cheese for every 4 baby rats alive_ . For example, with 25 baby rats, the cost to spawn another rat would be 10 + 10 \* floor(25/4) = 70 cheese. Spawning a baby rat incurs an **action cooldown cost of 10** .

## **Cats**

Cats are a 2 by 2 NPC with **4,000 points of health** and a **movement cooldown of 20** . Cats can also **turn to any facing direction** and **will not turn more than once per turn** . For each game, an even number of cats will spawn. **The following mechanics are provided to explain how the cats function, but you will not control the cat.**

Cats can sense map features and other robots up to √17 **units away** in the **180 degree cone** they are facing.

### **Attack**

A cat can damage rats in 4 ways:

- **Pounce** - The cat can jump a distance up to 3 units away in any direction, provided there is no wall, dirt, or rat king where it will land. More precisely, for any tile within sqrt(13) units of the cat’s center, the cat can land with any of its corners on that tile (given all landing positions are valid). Cats can pounce over obstacles like walls. Upon pouncing, all rats it lands on die immediately, and following this, the relevant cat traps are triggered. The cat only gets trapped by cat traps within the cat trap radius of the 2x2 grid of squares that the cat lands on, and does not get trapped in the middle of the pounce. Pounces incur _double the movement cooldown_ of regular cat movement, i.e. a total movement cooldown of **40** .

- **Scratch** - The cat will remain in place and do **20** damage to a rat in its vision cone. This incurs an **action cooldown of 15** .

- **Feeding** - Enemy rats can throw other rats into the space that the cat is occupying to feed the cat. The cat will immediately kill the thrown rat, then **sleep for 2 turns** . While sleeping the cat will not move or act.

- **Movement** - Cats can move onto squares currently occupied by a baby rat, immediately killing the rat. However, a cat cannot move onto a square occupied by a rat king, but it can attack and kill the rat king by scratching.

### **Sensing**

- The cat has a 180 degree vision cone of √17 and can sense all the same things as rats (except cat traps).

- The cat cannot differentiate between rats of different teams.

- Upon hearing a squeak, the cat will know the location of its source.

- Cats know the locations of all walls on the map and can use BFS to get around walls.

### **Movement**

The cat will spawn at the center before each game.

Each turn, the cat can move by either walking or pouncing. The cat can walk one square in the direction it is facing, provided its target destination has enough space and no dirt or rat kings. _Any cat movement or pouncing that lands on a baby-rat-occupied tile results in the instant destruction of that baby rat as well as any baby rat being carried._

Cats may remove dirt from any adjacent square. This has a cooldown of 30, and the removed soil is permanently gone in that game.

A cat can move when its movement cooldown is less than 10. Cats dig dirt with an **action cooldown of 30** .

### **Algorithm**

Every map will spawn with symmetric waypoints assigned to each cat. These waypoints are not visible to rats.

The cats will switch between the modes _Explore and Attack_ , **starting in Explore mode** at the beginning of every game.

**TLDR:** Cats spend most of their time in explore mode, traveling between waypoints. However, upon reaching each waypoint, the cat pauses its exploration and spends **8 turns** in attack mode, briefly attacking nearby rats. After the 8 turns, the cat is back in explore mode: it returns to its waypoint and proceeds in explore mode to the next waypoint. In explore mode, cats _ignore all rats_ unless they are blocking its path.

Below is a more detailed description of cat behavior in each mode.

#### **Explore mode** :

- Cat moves towards the next waypoint in its cycle of waypoints, using BFS around walls.

- During explore mode, cats _ignore all rats it sees or hears._ However, cats can still destroy any baby rats it moves across along its journey.

- If stuck on its path, i.e. if it encounters dirt or a rat king on its path:
  - The cat will try to dig away dirt if needed or alternatively scratch at the blocking rat king

  - If both digging and attacking fail (e.g. in the case of a wall), the cat will try to escape by pouncing in its facing direction.

  - If the cat is unable to do anything (digging, scratching, moving) for over 4 turns, it will keep turning in a random direction until it is able to perform an action.

- Chirality rule: the cat will follow waypoints using its bottom left corner if it is chirality 0, and using the analogous corner under map symmetry if it is chirality 1. (E.g. a cat with chirality 1 on a map with vertical symmetry follows waypoints with its bottom right corner; a cat with chirality 1 on a map with horizontal symmetry follows waypoints with its top left corner).

**Attack mode** :

- This is a brief 8-turn phase the cat enters upon reaching each waypoint.

- In this mode, a cat may hyper-focus on a rat that it senses, given that the rat remains in its vision cone.

- Within a single turn, the cat will repeat the following steps (in this order):
  1.  The cat listens for a squeak — if it hears any squeaks, it will take the first one it hears in that round and turn towards the squeak direction. Otherwise, the cat keeps its facing direction. In this sense, squeaks can serve as distractions for the cat’s facing direction.
      - a. The cat will listen for new squeaks on every turn, constantly clearing its buffer of previous turns’ squeaks.

  2.  Within its facing direction, the cat looks for its previous target rat. If there is no existing target rat (as is the case when first entering attack mode) or the cat loses sight of its target rat, the cat picks a rat in its vision cone and makes it the new target. (If there is no visible rat at all, the cat will simply rotate 45 degrees on this turn and wait until the next turn.)

  3.  The cat tries to attack its target. First, it tries to scratch the rat if it is within range; otherwise, the cat tries to pounce at the rat. If both of these fail, the cat will try to move in the direction of the target rat; if unable to move the cat will try to remove any blocking dirt.

- At the end of the attack phase, the target rat is erased from the cat’s memory, and the cat is set to explore mode again, finding its way to its most recent waypoint.

Note: all mode switches happen on the next cat turn. If during attack mode a cat’s direction becomes CENTER (e.g. due to arriving at its target rat location), it will set its facing direction to a random direction.

## **Communication**

Units can only see their immediate surroundings and are independently controlled by copies of your code, making coordination very challenging. You will be unable to share any variables between them; note that even static variables will not be shared, as each robot will receive its own copy.

Communication is done through a few methods:

1. A global array of 64 integer values between 0-1023

2. Squeaking

### **Global Array**

Any robot may read from the global array at any time, using the readSharedArray() method. However, only rat kings may write to the global array using the writeSharedArray() method.

### **Squeaking**

Rats may communicate with other baby rats by squeaking. Each rat can squeak **at most once per turn** by calling the squeak(int messageContent) method. This message will have the _messageContent integer, the robot's ID, current location at the time it squeaked, and the current round number_ in that order. **Cats and any allied rats** within a **sqrt(16) radius** will receive this message. Rats will not receive their own squeaks.

Squeaks will remain available for other robots to read for 5 rounds before disappearing.

## **Bytecode limits**

Robots are also very limited in the amount of computation they are allowed to perform per turn. Bytecodes are a convenient measure of computation in languages like Java, where one Java bytecode corresponds roughly to one basic operation such as “subtract” or “get field”, and a single line of code generally contains several bytecodes (for details see here). Because bytecodes are a feature of the compiled code itself, the same program will always compile to the same bytecodes and thus take the same amount of computation on the same inputs. This is great, because it allows us to avoid using time as a measure of computation, which leads to problems such as nondeterminism. With bytecode cutoffs, re-running the same match between the same bots produces exactly the same results - a feature you will find very useful for debugging.

Every round each robot sequentially takes its turn. If a robot attempts to exceed its bytecode limit (usually unexpectedly, if you have too big of a loop or something), its computation will be paused and then resumed at exactly that point next turn. The code will resume running just fine, but this can cause problems if, for example, you check if a tile is empty, then the robot is cut off and the others take their turns, and then you attempt to move into a now-occupied tile. Instead, use the Clock.yield() function to end a robot's turn. This will pause computation where you choose, and resume on the next line next turn.

The bytecode limit for all rats is **17500** , and the bytecode limit for all rat kings is **20000.**

Crossplay between Python and Java is supported for the first time this year! Python counts bytecode differently, so the bytecode of a Python bot is multiplied by **3** to approximately convert to Java bytecode before comparing with the Java bytecode limits. This multiplier only applies to native Python operations and does not apply to the standard functions and Battlecode functions in the text file linked below. Because of the imperfect nature of this conversion factor, it is generally the case that you should work in Java if you’re trying to optimize bytecode. In future years, a more accurate conversion might be used.

Some standard functions such as the math library and sensing functions have fixed bytecode costs, available here. More details on this at the end of the spec.

## **Appendix: Other resources and utilities**

### **Sample player**

Examplefuncsplayer, a simple player which performs various game actions, is included with Battlecode. It includes helpful comments and is a template you can use to see what RobotPlayer files should look like. Lectureplayer, a player which is implemented during the Battlecode lectures as an example of more complex strategies than examplefuncsplayer, is available as well. Both lectureplayer and examplefuncsplayer are available here in the corresponding directories for Java and Python.

If you are interested, you may find the full game engine implementation here. This is not at all required, but may be helpful if you are curious about the engine's implementation specifics.

### **Debugging**

Debugging is extremely important. See the debugging tips to learn about our useful debug tools.

### **Monitoring**

The Clock class provides a way to identify the current round (rc.getRoundNum()), and how many bytecodes have been executed during the current round (Clock.getBytecodeNum()).

### **GameActionExceptions**

GameActionExceptions are thrown when something cannot be done. It is often the result of illegal actions such as moving onto another robot, or an unexpected round change in your code. Thus, you must write your player defensively and handle GameActionExceptions judiciously. You should also be prepared for any ability to fail and make sure that this has as little effect as possible on the control flow of your program.

Throwing any Exceptions causes a bytecode penalty of 500 bytecodes. Unhandled exceptions may paralyze your robot.

### **Complete documentation**

Every function you could possibly use to interact with the game can be found in our javadocs.

## **Appendix: Other restrictions**

### **Java language usage**

Players may use classes from any of the packages listed in AllowedPackages.txt, except for classes listed in DisallowedPackages.txt. These files can be found here.

Furthermore, the following restrictions apply:

Object.wait, Object.notify, Object.notifyAll, Class.forName, and String.intern are not allowed. java.lang.System only supports out, arraycopy, and getProperty. Furthermore, getProperty can only be used to get properties with names beginning with "bc.testing.". java.io.PrintStream may not be used to open files.

Note that violating any of the above restrictions will cause the robots to explode when run, even if the source files compile without problems.

### **Memory usage**

Robots must keep their memory usage reasonable. If a robot uses more than 8 Mb of heap space during a tournament or scrimmage match, the robot may explode.

### **Execution Time Limits**

Robots must keep their execution time reasonable. While bytecode counting is intended for this exact purpose, some very advanced usages of Java can cause robots to run extremely slowly while remaining within bytecode limits. To reduce strain on our servers, we enforce a total execution time limit per-team. This is aggregated across all robots for the entire game, and reset between games in a single set. If a team exceeds this limit, their team will automatically resign and lose the set. These constants are accessible via game constants, and you can query how much time has elapsed via the Clock class.

This shouldn’t affect the majority of players. If you find yourself running into this issue, ensure your Java files are not exceedingly large, as this can cause an issue with execution time.

### **More information on bytecode costs**

Classes in java.util, java.math, and scala and their subpackages are bytecode counted as if they were your own code. The following functions in java.lang are also bytecode counted as if they were your own code.

`Math.random StrictMath.random String.matches String.replaceAll String.replaceFirst String.split`

The function System.arraycopy costs one bytecode for each element copied. All other functions have a fixed bytecode cost. These costs are listed in the MethodCosts.txt file. Methods not listed are free. The bytecode costs of battlecode.common functions are also listed in the javadoc.

Basic operations like integer comparison and array indexing cost small numbers of bytecodes each.

Bytecodes relating to the creation of arrays (specifically NEWARRAY, ANEWARRAY, and MULTIANEWARRAY; see here for reference) have an effective cost greater than a single bytecode. This is because these instructions, although they are represented as a single bytecode, can be vastly more expensive than other instructions in terms of computational cost. To remedy this, these instructions have a bytecode cost equal to the total length of the instantiated array. Note that this should have minimal impact on the typical team, and is only intended to prevent teams from repeatedly instantiating excessively large arrays.

## **Appendix: Engine & API Clarifications (from Changelog)**

- **Rat King Action/Attack Radii (V1.0.7, V1.1.4, V1.1.5):** Because a Rat King is a 3x3 unit, actions performed on "adjacent locations" (like attacking/biting) extend from its outer perimeter, meaning it can attack all **16 surrounding tiles**, which corresponds to `GameConstants.RAT_KING_ATTACK_DISTANCE_SQUARED = 8` measured from the King's center.
- **Rat King Formation Cheese (V1.0.7):** When 7+ baby rats merge into a Rat King, the **center baby rat's** raw cheese is _also_ contributed to the global pool (in addition to the surrounding baby rats).
- **Placing Traps on Enemy Traps (V1.1.5):** You _are_ allowed to place a trap on a tile that already contains a hidden enemy trap.
- **Squeak Deduplication (V1.1.6):** Multi-tile robots (like Rat Kings and Cats) only receive a squeaked message **once** per squeak, even if multiple tiles of their body are within the √16 radius.
- **Cat Action Cooldown Conflict (V1.1.4):** While the main spec notes Cat Scratch has an action cooldown of 15 and Cat Digging has an action cooldown of 30, Changelog V1.1.4 states: _"Nerf cats to decrease randomness: 15 -> 30 action cooldown, 10000 -> 4000 health, 50 -> 20 scratch damage"_.
- **API & Method Notes:**
  - Use `canBuildRat` and `buildRat` (renamed from `canBuildRobot`/`buildRobot` in V1.0.3).
  - Constants use `RAT_KING` with an underscore, not `RATKING` (V1.0.3).
  - `rc.canTurn(Direction)` exists to check for null and `CENTER` directions (V1.0.6).
  - `isTurningReady()` was removed (V1.0.7).
  - `MapLocation.isWithinDistanceSquared` uses `useBottomLeft` (V1.0.7).
  - In `TrapType`, use `maxCount` instead of `trapLimit` (V1.1.5).
  - Rats can choose the exact amount of cheese to pick up (V1.2.1).
  - Methods exist to retrieve the backstabbing team and your team's active rat/cat trap counts (V1.2.2).
