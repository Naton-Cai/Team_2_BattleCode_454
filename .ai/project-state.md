# Project state

**Date:** 2026-10-16.

Observed implementation. These notes do not add requirements.

## Test cases

**Status:** Implemented. Verified on 2026-10-16 with `./gradlew test --rerun-tasks`. JaCoCo line coverage was 42 covered and 14 missed, ratio 0.75. The 0.70 gate passed.

Each turn test calls `playTurn` with a `TestRobotController` and returns. Tests do not call `run`, because that method loops on `Clock.yield()`. `TestRobotController` supplies the answers for one scenario. A true `canMoveForward` does not establish that the engine would allow the step. The `% 100` type print in `RobotPlayer` is not covered by a test.

`playTurn` does not branch on unit type, so each BabyRat entry and the matching RatKing entry currently name the same method in `ratplayer.RobotPlayerTest` and `examplefuncsplayer.RobotPlayerTest`. `TestRobotController` starts as `UnitType.BABY_RAT` unless a test changes it.

### BabyRat

- `movesForwardWhenAllowed`: when forward is allowed, the turn calls `moveForward` once and does not turn. `turnCount` becomes 1.
- `movesForwardInEachFacing`: for each facing except `CENTER`, a forward move calls `moveForward` once, does not turn, and leaves that facing in place. The test sets the facing.
- `turnsOnceWhenForwardIsBlocked`: when forward is blocked and a turn is allowed, the turn calls `turn` once with one of the eight facings and does not move.
- `skipsTurnWhenForwardIsBlockedAndTurnIsRefused`: a refused turn calls neither action. Allowing a turn on the next call then records one facing turn and still does not move.
- `turnsTwiceWhenForwardStaysBlocked`: two blocked turns with turning allowed record two facing turns and no move.
- `movesOnceBetweenBlockedTurns`: a blocked turn, a forward move, then another blocked turn records one move and two facing turns.
- `containsGameActionExceptionFromMove`: a `GameActionException` from `moveForward` stays inside `playTurn`. The move was attempted and no turn was attempted.
- `containsGameActionExceptionFromTurn`: a `GameActionException` from `turn` stays inside `playTurn`. The turn was attempted and no move was attempted.
- `containsUnexpectedExceptionFromForwardCheck`: a `RuntimeException` from `canMoveForward` stays inside `playTurn`. Neither action runs.

### RatKing

- `movesForwardWhenAllowed`: when forward is allowed, the turn calls `moveForward` once and does not turn. `turnCount` becomes 1.
- `movesForwardInEachFacing`: for each facing except `CENTER`, a forward move calls `moveForward` once, does not turn, and leaves that facing in place. The test sets the facing.
- `turnsOnceWhenForwardIsBlocked`: when forward is blocked and a turn is allowed, the turn calls `turn` once with one of the eight facings and does not move.
- `skipsTurnWhenForwardIsBlockedAndTurnIsRefused`: a refused turn calls neither action. Allowing a turn on the next call then records one facing turn and still does not move.
- `turnsTwiceWhenForwardStaysBlocked`: two blocked turns with turning allowed record two facing turns and no move.
- `movesOnceBetweenBlockedTurns`: a blocked turn, a forward move, then another blocked turn records one move and two facing turns.
- `containsGameActionExceptionFromMove`: a `GameActionException` from `moveForward` stays inside `playTurn`. The move was attempted and no turn was attempted.
- `containsGameActionExceptionFromTurn`: a `GameActionException` from `turn` stays inside `playTurn`. The turn was attempted and no move was attempted.
- `containsUnexpectedExceptionFromForwardCheck`: a `RuntimeException` from `canMoveForward` stays inside `playTurn`. Neither action runs.
